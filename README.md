# RRT-for-Path-Finding-for-2-end-point


Path planning is a crucial aspect of robotics, especially for autonomous robots operating in dynamic environments. It involves finding an optimal path from a start point to a goal point while avoiding obstacles and considering various constraints such as time, energy, and smoothness of motion.

Rapidly-exploring Random Tree: RRT* is a popular algorithm in the field of robotic motion planning. It is an extension of the original RRT algorithm and is designed to efficiently search for feasible paths in high-dimensional configuration spaces. The key advantage of RRT* over RRT is its ability to converge to an optimal solution over time, producing paths with lower costs.

To address this, RRT* (Rapidly-exploring Random Tree Star) extends RRT by continuously optimizing the tree structure to converge towards an optimal solution, resulting in higher-quality paths for robot navigation in dynamic and cluttered environments.
